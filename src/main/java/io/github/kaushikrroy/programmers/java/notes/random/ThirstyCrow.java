/**
 * <p>There are N pots. Every pots has some water in it. They may be partially filled . Every pot is associated with
 * overflow number O which tell how many minimum no. of stones required for that pot to overflow. The crow know O1 to
 * On(overflow no. for all the pots). Crow wants some K pots to be overflow.  So the task is minimum number of stones
 * he can make K pots overflow in worst case.
 * <br>
 * <br>Array of overflow no--. {1,...On}
 * <br>Number of pots--n
 * <br>No of pots to overflow-- k
 * <br>
 * <br>Let say two pots are there with overflow no.s {5,58}, and crow has to overflow one pot(k=1). So crow will put 5
 * stones in pot with overflow no.(58), it will not overflow, then he will put in pot with overflow no.(5), hence the
 * total no. of stones to make overflow one pot is=10.
 * <br>
 * <br>What are the best algorithm to do it?</p>
