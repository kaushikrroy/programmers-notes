# Binomial Coefficient
In mathematics, any of the positive integers that occurs as a coefficient in the binomial theorem is a binomial coefficient. Commonly, a binomial coefficient is indexed by a pair of integers n ≥ k ≥ 0 and is written <sup>n</sup>C<sub>k</sub>. It is the coefficient of the xk term in the polynomial expansion of the binomial power (1 + x)<sup>n</sup>, and it is given by the formula

A binomial coefficient C(n, k) gives the number of ways, disregarding order, that k objects can be chosen from among n objects; more formally, the number of k-element subsets (or k-combinations) of an n-element set.

The binomial coefficients can be found by the recurrence relation

<sup>n</sup>C<sub>k</sub> = <sup>n-1</sup>C<sub>k-1</sub> + <sup>n-1</sup>C<sub>k</sub>
 
with, <sup>n</sup>C<sub>0</sub> = <sup>n</sup>C<sub>n</sub> = 1
