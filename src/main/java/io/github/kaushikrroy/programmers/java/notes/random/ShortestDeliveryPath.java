/**
 * <p>A delivery boy wants to deliver some items on his way from office to home. You need to find the optimized path he
 * should take from office to home and deliver all his deliveries on his way.
 * <br>
 * <br>It is 101 X 101 grid. Office, home , delivery points are represented via coordinated (x,y) where 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 100,
 * 0 &lt;= y &lt;= 100.
 * <br>
 * <br>distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2,y2) is computed as |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|
 * <br>
 * <br>You need to find the optimized path from office to home covering all delivery locations and return the
 * optimized path length as output.
 * <br>
 * <br>You will be given the input in the 2 lines
 * <br>
 * <br>first line - N (no. of delivery locations)
 * <br>second line - (x,y) coordinates of office, followed by home, followed by all N delivery locations.
 * <br>

 * <br>
 * <br>output: The length of the optimized path taken.
